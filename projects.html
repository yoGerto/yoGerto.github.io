      This page will be used to show off some of the projects I am working on.

      My Current Projects are:
      <ul>
        <li>Baseball Bat VRChat World</li>
        <li>Utility scripts for developing VRChat Worlds</li>
        <li>This website :)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      The programing skills I am trying to develop are:
      <ul>
        <li>C#</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I hope by developing the scripts needed for the VRChat/Unity related
            projects that I will be able to develop my C# knowledge
          </li>
          <li>
            But I would also like to develop a Desktop application, perhaps a
            simple PC temperature measuring program would be nice?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</li>
        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>React</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      The programming languages I already have experience using are:
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Used Python during my first year at University, where I was able to
            enjoy how easy Python was to use as a beginner
          </li>
          <li>
            Also used Python during my Final Year Project at University. For
            this project I designed and created a prototype for a 'Dynamic
            Tannoy' system, which can adjust the sound from the speakers based
            on the volume level received at the microphone.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The final product that was created at the end admittedly wasn't
              very good...
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe that the core idea behind this product isn't very
              practical and wouldn't make a good product in the real world, due
              to the costs of all of the parts needed to make it work for such a
              minimal benefit.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Embedded C</li>
      </ul>
