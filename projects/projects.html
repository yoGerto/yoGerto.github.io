        My Current Projects are:
        <ul>
          <li>Baseball Bat VRChat World</li>
          <li>Utility scripts for developing VRChat Worlds</li>
          <li>This website :)</li>

          The programing skills I am trying to develop are:
          <ul>
            <li>C#</li>
            <ul class="nested-list">
              <li>
                I hope by developing the scripts needed for the VRChat/Unity
                related projects that I will be able to develop my C# knowledge
              </li>
              <li>
                But I would also like to develop a Desktop application, perhaps
                a simple PC temperature measuring program would be nice?

          The programming languages I already have experience using are:
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <ul class="nested-list">
              <li>
                Used Python during my first year at University, where I was able
                to enjoy how easy Python was to use as a beginner
              </li>
              <li>
                Also used Python during my Final Year Project at University. For
                this project I designed and created a prototype for a 'Dynamic
                Tannoy' system, which can adjust the sound from the speakers
                based on the volume level received at the microphone.
              </li>
              <ul class="nested-list">
                <li>
                  The final product that was created at the end admittedly
                  wasn't very good...
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe that the core idea behind this product isn't very
                  practical and wouldn't make a good product in the real world,
                  due to the costs of all of the parts needed to make it work
                  for such a minimal benefit.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Embedded C</li>
